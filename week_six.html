        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any blockers?</p>

        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>On Friday I started refining the branding and messed around with colours and type again. Today I’ll start piecing together the hi-fi screens, starting with the dashboard. Still not fully sold on the style direction — keeps shifting a bit.</p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Got a rough dashboard screen going and started branding main screens - history, FAQ’s. I’ve been struggling with branding and working on that in parallel and completed a more refined version of brand guidelines and digital style guide. Today I will continue building out the other core screens and try keep things consistent with the branding. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday, I tried branding more screens - history, FAQ’S, articles and also played around more with the colours. Also tried quickly tested (prototyping and linking pages) how the layout might work.  Today I will continue to refine and build my prototype and test on users. Scheduling conflicts with user testing - though was able to get one person.</p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I was able to do one user test and continue refining the branding the pages and features of the app. Today I will look at app references and dashboards/onboarding flows (e.g. apple pairing with apple watch) to try to apply the app. I will use the feedback I got from today’s session and continue to refine the hifi prototype. Still having scheduling conflicts.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday, I did rough drafts for new screens I will apply - like the onboarding and pairing process. Also fixed some colours used for the app. Today I will continue refining the app - looking at existing apps and fixing the branding. I will also try to tweak the solution a bit more so it has a better meaning and purpose for the users. For the type brief, I have a rough final product (picking a font and colours) so I can just refine it a little bit next week. No blockers.</p>

        <h1>Sprint Retrospective</h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>1. What went well</h2>
        <p>I was able to build out most of the core hi-fi screens while refining the branding alongside it. I also got one user test in, which gave me helpful feedback I can work from. Even though I was jumping between tasks, I slowly started making the design system feel more consistent. From last week I got used to writing things first on paper really quick and then translate it digitally easily. So the feedback I got from the presentation I was able to apply that relatively quick since I have to move on to coding next week.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. What didn&#39;t go well</h2>
        <p>For this week, the main blocker was scheduling user testing but in the end managed to test with three people, it was just late in the week. Because of that, I didn’t get as much feedback as I hoped at the start, and I felt behind since the week was already ending so I needed to apply the changes quickly. I also had trouble applying the branding to the app; I was unsure of how to use the colours, assets etc. This could be because I was working on it in parallel so little details kept getting changed and I got confused, though it is much clearer now.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. What can be improved</h2>
        <p>I need to stop getting stuck in constant visual tweaking and just commit to a solid direction earlier. I also need to approach feedback with a clearer focus. like testing for specific things (e.g. if people understand the dashboard or if the onboarding makes sense) instead of trying to get general thoughts. I think I could’ve worked on my user testing planning better in this way. Scheduling-wise, I should plan out testing earlier in the week so I’m not rushing or relying on last-minute availability. Also, I want to make sure the app doesn’t just look good but actually communicates its purpose and value more clearly.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. What actions will I take for the next sprint</h2>
        <p>I’ll focus on locking in the current design decisions and avoid reworking visuals so I can move forward with building efficiently. I’ll apply feedback by trying to test smaller sections of the app as I go (if I can), like checking if the pairing flow or dashboard interactions make sense, instead of waiting to test everything at the end. To avoid blockers, I’ll plan out tasks in smaller chunks and give myself room to troubleshoot.</p>
