        <h1>Daily Standup</h1>
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any blockers?</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>Today I will look more closely in the brief and list the tasks to do. I will also start looking into areas I might be interested in tackling. No blockers in particular for today.</p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I did broad research on environmental topics - like food security, environmental regeneration in NZ. Today I will look deeper into statistics and more primary research to narrow down my ideas. I might also (loosely) ask around to fuel some assumptions I have. The main blocker is just trying to fully understand the brief, which might take some time still but it's still a little confusing.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>I went back to my research and looked more into an area that I'm interested in, looking at statistics and common themes. Today, I saw a lot of new ideas from the class, so I'll do a super quick brainstorm to see if I can get more ideas I can relate to and try connect it to the research I did. It is taking me quite a while to get a topic that I will be interested in, but I just need to pick one and confirm if it is okay to go forward with it.</p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I came up with a few problem statements to bring to class to explore. I have 3 that I want to look more into. I also started planning my term using scrum methodology. Today, I saw a lot of new ideas from the class, so I want to do a super quick brainstorm to see if I can get more ideas I can relate to and try connect it to the research I did. Blockers is the time and finalising ideas that I want to look more into. I feel like I'm a bit behind so I need to speed up the process.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I looked at my brainstorm and research and tried to connect the two. I found an area that I want to stick with (environmental regeneration) and looked at daily problems that I, people around me have, and what it might have in common regarding the environment. I also started drafting some interview questions for next week. Today, I will confirm my idea to see if it is okay to go forward with it. If it is okay, then I will continue creating my interview questions and prepare for next week's UX research. If not, I will continue to refine my problem statement and look further in my research. No blockers in particular.</p>

        <h1>Sprint Retrospective</h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>1. What went well</h2>
        <p>What went well this week was that I was able to take a step back and look at my research from a wider perspective. Once I did that, I started to see better connections between different ideas and could use what I had already found in more meaningful ways. After doing brainstorms and the research, I felt more confident towards the end of the week with the direction (problem statement) that I was going to go with.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. What didn&#39;t go well</h2>
        <p>I spent too much time looking into just one area. I was really focused on it, but then after seeing what other students were exploring, I realised I could try something more personal that I actually relate to. That made me step back and look at things more broadly again. I also started looking for connections between the new ideas and the research I had already done, which helped make things feel more relevant. Though, I think eventually all the research I did in the one area (environment) was really useful when finding the problem statement.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. What can be improved</h2>
        <p>What I can improve is the way I structure my research and planning phases. I need to allow more time for open exploration before narrowing down, rather than trying to define the direction too quickly. I also need a better system for keeping track of evolving ideas. Right now, things get lost or feel disconnected. Building in short, regular check-ins with myself or through mentoring could help me stay focused while still staying open to shifts in direction.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. What actions will I take for the next sprint</h2>
        <p>Next sprint, I will refer to my term schedule that I created and follow it accordingly. I will try to move quicker and move on with my tasks to make sure I am not falling behind with the schedule. I will also try to do mentoring earlier in the week so I get more work done and stay on track.</p>
