        <h1>Daily Standup</h1>
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any blockers?</p>

        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>On Friday, I got approval for my problem statement, so I can go forward with my idea. I also created my interview questions and asked for participants. Today I will interview my participants to gather UX research and start looking into insights. No blockers in particular for today.</p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I completed my interviews, looked at key insights and then used those to refine my problem statement a bit more. Today I will complete my empathy maps and user journey and then look more closely at competitors and/or existing responses and brainstorm solutions. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I completed empathy maps, along with personas to understand the target audience, which I have also finalised. Today I will continue looking for solutions and existing competitors and hand in my WIP 01 slide deck. I will also do a current state user journey and ideate solutions using the method we did in joint class lecture and the SCAMPER method. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I handed in my WIP slides, finished the current state user journey and did some more ideation for the solution. Today I will continue to ideate for more solutions in preparation for my WIP tomorrow for discussion. I will also work on the Type Here brief and ideate some ideas using the methods we did in class. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I used the ideation techniques (crazy 8’s) and also brainstormed more for the Type Here brief. Today I will present my WIP 01 and gather feedback to continue iterating my solution or any other areas. But after, I will mainly focus a more on the Type Here brief and continue ideating from yesterday. No blockers.</p>

        <h1>Sprint Retrospective</h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>1. What went well</h2>
        <p>What went well in this week’s sprint was that the interviews went smoothly. I was able to complete most of them on Monday and early Tuesday, with four participants in total. From my experience with interviews last term, I felt more confident in the process and knew what I was looking for. The questions I asked led to really useful insights and helped shape the direction of my project. I was able to identify patterns, frustrations, and possible areas for solutions based on what participants shared.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. What didn&#39;t go well</h2>
        <p>What didn’t go well was the ideation stage. During my desk research, I struggled to find existing competitors that directly address the problem I’m focusing on. Most of what I found was loosely related, but nothing specific. This made it harder to come up with solution ideas because I had less to reference or compare with.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. What can be improved</h2>
        <p>Next time, I want to move more quickly from insights to sketching possible ideas, even if they’re rough. I spent too long trying to find a “perfect” reference or example, when I could have started visualising my own concepts earlier. For the upcoming low-fidelity prototyping sprint, I’ll focus on turning key insights into quick, testable ideas instead of overthinking them.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. What actions will I take for the next sprint</h2>
        <p>My focus going into the next sprint will be turning my insights into clear design ideas. I’ll start sketching and building low-fidelity prototypes, and based on what I’ve learned so far, I’ll try not to overthink the first concepts. Now that my ideas and solutions are more refined, I’ll use them to guide my wireframes and keep things simple and focused. I’ll also prioritise early testing — both with users and during mentoring — so I can get useful feedback before I go too far in one direction. On top of that, I’ll aim to iterate quickly and test again through the week, so I’m better prepared for the next phase.</p>
