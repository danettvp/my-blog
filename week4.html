        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>On Friday I worked on a draft of the design strategy document and made a checklist to ensure I included everything. I also played around a little bit with interactions I could do for my type poster. Today I will start putting the information into the document. I also plan to finalise some moodboards for the visual direction. No blockers </p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I finished 3 moodboards of visual directions I could go for - ended up focusing on 2. I also filled out a brand strategy to further understand the enterprise. Today I will continue to fill out the design strategy document and create stylescapes. I will also put together my pitch presentation slides. No blockers</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I created one stylescape with the visual direction I want to put the most focus on. I also finished planning out the flow of the presentation and the slides in between. Today I will figure out the starting and end of my presentation and then continue with the document. No blockers. </p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I finalised my pitch presentation slides and submitted. I also worked on the digital design section a bit more on my design strategy document. Today I will gather feedback from my pitch presentation - like experimenting more with the visual direction. I will also start prototyping some posters for the type brief. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I presented my pitch presentation and worked on my design strategy document a bit more. Today I will finish the final section of the design strategy document (the plan), proof check, and then submit. I will also continuing prototyping and vibe coding my type poster. No blockers.</p>

        <h1>Sprint Retrospective</h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>1. What went well</h2>
        <p>This week was productive and smooth I completed and submitted my pitch presentation and the design strategy document. I created three moodboards, focused in on two, and developed a strong stylescape that supported my chosen visual direction, but will continue developing into next week. This made it easier to actually visualise the solution and the path that it was taking.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. What didn&#39;t go well</h2>
        <p>Even though the visual side came together well, I didn’t really give the digital design and UX sections the attention they needed. They felt a bit rushed and not as considered as the rest of the project. I think I focused on the visual direction too much when that was more of the focus for next week. I also kind of rushed over user interactions with the digital design, which left a gap between the concept and how it would actually function. I put too much focus on other sections of the design strategy more than I intended to.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. What can be improved</h2>
        <p>I definitely want to put more thought into the UX and digital side of the project moving forward. Right now, a lot of the focus has been on how things look and feel visually, but I haven’t really mapped out how people will interact with it in a clear, intentional way. I also realised it's much easier for me to understand concepts and the flow of things if I write it down on paper first. I feel like I can see the gaps or what’s missing more clearly that way, instead of just jumping straight into digital.</p>

        <h2>4. What actions will I take for the next sprint</h2>
        <p>Next sprint, I’m going to try sketching things out by hand first—especially when it comes to figuring out flows or interaction ideas. It helps me process things better and makes it easier to build a more thoughtful digital experience. I also want to revisit feedback more actively and let it shape where I go next, especially when something doesn’t quite feel resolved yet.</p>
