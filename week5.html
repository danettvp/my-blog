        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I collected references for colors and fonts that match the tone of the solution. Today I’m testing basic font options and creating a simple color palette. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I chose main brand colors and two typefaces for headings and body. Today I’m testing them in basic UI elements to see how they feel together. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I applied the fonts and colors to a few sample screens.
            Today I’m creating a few basic UI assets using those styles (buttons, text styles).
            No blockers. </p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I made sure fonts and colors were used consistently across screens.
            Today I’m starting a simple style guide to document the choices.
            No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I built a draft of the style guide with color codes and font names.
            Today I’m finishing it and getting ready to use it in next week’s prototype updates.
            No blockers.</p>

        <h1>Sprint Retrospective</h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>1. What went well</h2>
        <p>This week, I focused on defining the core digital brand identity by working on fonts, colors, and essential UI assets. I kept the scope simple, which helped me make solid decisions and establish a clear visual direction that feels approachable and fits the solution. I applied these choices across sample screens and started building a style guide to keep everything organized and consistent. I was able to quickly mockup how this brand could be applied to the prototype, helping me visualise the visual direction and branding of the enterprise better.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. What didn&#39;t go well</h2>
        <p>What didn’t go well was that I struggled to find a fully cohesive style at first. The different elements didn’t always feel like they belonged together, so I spent time adjusting and experimenting to get everything aligned. This really slowed me down for the week, I got really confused with the moodboards I was making and it was hard to apply or see a strong visual direction.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. What can be improved</h2>
        <p>What can be improved is managing the tendency to overwork the brand identity, which led to confusion and drifting too far from the original vision. Constantly revisiting and changing details slowed progress and made the style feel inconsistent. Moving forward, I need to commit to a clearer direction earlier and avoid over-editing so I can maintain momentum and create a more cohesive identity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. What actions will I take for the next sprint</h2>
        <p>For the next sprint, I’ll test this brand direction with users and peers to validate the approach and make adjustments based on their input. I’ll expand the style guide with clear examples so it’s more useful, and I’ll apply the brand identity more deeply within actual screens and flows. The foundation is there — now it’s about refining and making it feel more cohesive and confident.</p>
