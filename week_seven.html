        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>On Friday, I continued with coding my type poster and looked into developing my hifi prototype with the references and inspiration I collected. Today I will continue to finalise and develop my hifi and get user testing feedback. User testing feedback was really pushed back, making me behind.</p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I did my interviews, and tweaked my hifi according to the feedback. Today I will create the code files to the final product app and try to start coding. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I worked on coding my hifi and updated my style guide. Today I will try to finish the type brief poster and continue coding. No blockers </p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I continued coding my app and got a presentation slide ready. I also started thinking about the case study Today I will try to submit the type brief and continue coding the main pages of my app like the dashboard and continue implementing the database. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I tried fixing the css for the app and was gathering collateral for the case study. Today I will try to get all designs and assets finalised to put into a finished brand guideline, style guide etc. I will also continue coding my app and sorting out the database. I keep forgetting to commit my code.</p>
