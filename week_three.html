        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>On Friday I presented my WIP 01, got feedback, and used that to refine my ideas, especially around the solution. I also created mood boards for the Type Here brief. Today I focused on refining my solution further and started working on my low-fidelity prototype. There were no blockers.</p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I refined my solution more andstarted looking into existing products or field studies with similar ideas to see what is already out there. Today I will start thinking about the proof of concept for my brand/enterprise. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I gathered more references and examples to help frame my proof of concept. Today I focused on competitor research and analysis, like using SWOT, tables, and a matrix to map things out. I also continued refining my solution to make sure it connects clearly with my target audience. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I worked on narrowing down and clarifying my insight and solution using the in-class activity. Today I focused on summarising my competitor analysis so I could move forward with user flows and strengthening my proof of concept. I also spent time refining the solution and setting aside time for the Type Here brief — mainly ideating, testing out code, and getting a feel for the visual direction. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I wrapped up my competitor analysis (table and matrix), finished the user flows, and developed my proof of concept further. I also started building the current state user journey with my solution in mind. Today, I shifted focus to the Type Here brief — testing and coding ideas for the type poster and working on some draft layouts. For the New Enterprise brief, I also plan to keep developing my idea and iterating on both the solution and user flows. Completing the social business model is on the backlog. No blockers.</p>

        <h1>Sprint Retrospective</h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>1. What went well</h2>
        <p>What went well this week was developing a more clear and refined solution to my problem. After doing the research, flows, and competitor analysis I could actually see how the concept could work. Creating the user journey helped me figure out what the user’s experience would be like in a more realistic way. It made the project feel more like it was coming together. The proof of concept also started to feel stronger and made more sense as I did prototypes and field research/case studies.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>2. What didn&#39;t go well</h2>
        <p>What didn&#39;t go so well was developing the Type Here brief. I came into the week wanting to get more done on it, but I struggled to build strong ideas or a working direction. Even though I started experimenting and trying out code and layout ideas, I didn&#39;t feel confident about where it was going. I think I was still unsure how to turn the brief into something that felt purposeful or aligned with what I wanted to say.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>3. What can be improved</h2>
        <p>One thing I could improve is being more intentional about how I connect design choices back to insights. I tend to jump into flows and sketches with a general sense of the idea, but I sometimes skip over clearly linking it to what the user actually needs or feels, so I have to go back and iterate a lot. I want to be more conscious about the decisions I make at each step making sure every part of the design is grounded, not just assumed, so the process is quicker and I can move on.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. What actions will I take for the next sprint</h2>
        <p>Next sprint, I’ll focus on translating all the research and flows into a working lofi prototype for New Enterprise. This will also contribute to the design strategy document and pitch presentation. I’ll build it out enough that it can be tested and give me something to react to. For the Type Here brief, I’ll push forward with one direction and explore how I can bring more of my perspective into it, instead of waiting for it to feel perfect.</p>
