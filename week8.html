        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>On Friday, I handed in my type poster and continued coding my site - finished the boilerplate for the app. I also started putting the case study together and finalised the styleguide. Today I will complete the basic code for the main pages I will code, like the last scan and smart tips and log page and just make sure the database is at a functioning point. This is so I can focus on the visual collateral tomorrow (presentation and case study). No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I finalised the database and made sure it was working. I also finished majority of the basic layouts for the pages - last scan, smart tips, logging food, and viewing the posts. Today I will focus on putting the presentation together, practicing, and mocking up in final images for the case study. If I have time, I will refine the hifi for my website landing page. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I finished my slides and case study. Today I will continue to debug any minor problems in my code and keep refining the code while also branding the pages - so adding colours and styles so it looks more like the hifi. I will also try to finalise the database, which is in the last scan page. No blockers. </p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I styed all the main pages using css and deployed the site to netlify. Today I will keep refining my code and finalised the images and project statement for the case study. I will also finalise the website landing page and maybe do a quick mockup of a poster for CMS. No blockers.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I finished the CMS portion (website landing page and a poster) and made tweaks to the code. I also added a new page (history.html) since I had time. Today I will double check all my work, clean up my figma so it's a little more clear to follow, and then submit. yayyy! </p>
