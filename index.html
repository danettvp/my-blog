        <h2>1. What went well</h2>
        <p>This week wasn&#39;t exactly smooth, but it was still productive in its own way. I started off with quite a narrow focus, which ended up feeling a bit limiting. But that process helped me realise I needed to zoom out and take a broader look at the topic again. Once I did that, I was able to bring in earlier research and start connecting ideas in a more meaningful way. It wasn&#39;t linear, but by the end of the week I felt like I was finally moving in a clearer direction.</p>

        <h2>2. What didn&#39;t go well</h2>
        <p>I think I restricted myself too much at the start, trying to force clarity too early. That made it harder to explore freely and led to some frustration. I also noticed that I was second-guessing my ideas instead of letting them develop naturally. Not having a structured way to reflect on or track evolving thoughts probably made that worse.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>3. What can be improved</h2>
        <p>One thing I&#39;ve learned is that it&#39;s okay to step back and reassess â€” even if it feels like I&#39;m going backwards. It actually helped me use my earlier research in a more thoughtful way. Going forward, I want to give myself more space to explore without over-committing too early. Having some kind of lightweight reflection or synthesis method during the week would probably help too.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. What actions will I take for the next sprint</h2>
        <p>Next sprint, I&#39;m going to allow more time for broad exploration upfront, then narrow down more intentionally. I&#39;ll also keep notes on how my ideas are shifting, so I can reflect as I go rather than waiting until I feel stuck. That way I can make better use of what I&#39;ve already learned while still staying open to new directions.</p>
